        <P>We, at the Grade One Mart, have come a long way to fulfill our users’ day to day and basic needs. We are
            supplying quality meat to the residents of twin cities. Now there is no need to wait to go for meat
            shopping. Our main purpose is to free our users from the hassle of roaming at the local meat store in
            Islamabad and bargaining with the local vendors. Just a few clicks and you will get all you need right at
            your doorsteps.</P>
        <P>With a wide range of products to choose from, we aim to provide you quality meat at affordable prices. You no
            longer have to search for a meat store near me. All you’ve got to do is simply place an order through our
            website or message us via WhatsApp to purchase your desired item and get it delivered within a few hours.
            Customers can also keep track of their orders through their account’s user area. The best thing about our
            online meat store is that we provide the easiest means of communication to interact with our customers. We
            provide you with the following features:</P>
        <P>• If you are in hurry or finding it difficult to order through the website, then simply send us an name of
            the required product. You can even maintain a pre-made list of your own and add or remove products later,
            accordingly.
            • Our customer support agents are available for 16 hours a day, i.e., from 9 am to 1 am, so you can get your
            queries resolved during these hours. <br>
            • We strive hard to satisfy our customers. Therefore, we have introduced an Open Box delivery system, which
            means that customers would be allowed to check the product quality and quantity before paying the amount
            charged against it because we truly believe that “Honesty is the Best Policy.” <br>
            • Moreover, you will find many useful products or brands that you often forget to buy when shopping at local
            grocery stores. You can purchase them or add them to the cart immediately so that you don’t forget again.
            <br>
            By providing such features and benefits, we try our best to maintain the quality and standard of our store.
            The world is becoming more advance day by day, and this leads to a busy lifestyle and hectic schedule for
            everyone. All we want is to provide comfort and ease to our people by saving their time and energy so that
            they can invest it in other important tasks.

            to help you unless you are willing to help yourself. So, don’t wait any longer, try our service for once and
